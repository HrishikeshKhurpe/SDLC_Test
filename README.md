# Hrishikesh's Calculator\n\n## Overview\nHrishikesh's Calculator is a Python-based calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n## File Structure\n```\ncalculator/\n├── calculator.py\n└── tests/\n    └── test_calculator.py\n```\n\n## Test Case Structure\nThe test cases for the calculator are located in the `calculator/tests/test_calculator.py` file. These tests cover the basic arithmetic operations and ensure the calculator works as expected.\n\n## Run Book\n1. Install the required dependencies (if any) by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n2. Run the calculator script: `python calculator/calculator.py`\n3. The script will demonstrate the usage of the calculator by performing sample calculations and printing the results.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Python 3.x\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HrishikeshKhurpe/SDLC_Test.git`\n2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SDLC_Test`\n3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`\n4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`\n5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n6. Run the calculator script: `python calculator/calculator.py`\n\n## API Documentation\nThe Hrishikesh's Calculator module provides the following public methods:\n\n- `add(a, b)`: Adds two numbers and returns the result.\n- `subtract(a, b)`: Subtracts two numbers and returns the result.\n- `multiply(a, b)`: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.\n- `divide(a, b)`: Divides two numbers and returns the result. Raises a `ValueError` if the divisor is zero.\n\n## Architecture\nThe calculator module is designed with a single class, `Hrishikesh_Calculator`, which encapsulates the basic arithmetic operations. The class is self-contained and does not have any external dependencies. The test suite ensures the correctness of the calculator's functionality.
