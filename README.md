# Hrishikesh's Calculator\n\n## Overview\nHrishikesh's Calculator is a Python-based calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n## File Structure\n```\n.\n├── src\n│   └── features\n│       └── calculator\n│           └── calculator.py\n└── tests\n    └── test_calculator.py\n```\n\n## Test Case Structure\nThe test cases for the calculator are located in the `tests/test_calculator.py` file. The test suite covers the following scenarios:\n\n- Verifying the correct behavior of the `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()` functions\n- Handling invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values)\n- Handling edge cases like division by zero\n\nTo run the tests, execute the following command from the project root directory:\n\n```\npython -m unittest discover tests\n```\n\n## Run Book\nTo use the Hrishikesh's Calculator, follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.\n2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\n3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it.\n4. Install the required dependencies (if any) by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n5. Import the `Hrishikesh_Calculator` class from `src.features.calculator.calculator` and create an instance.\n6. Use the available methods (`add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`) to perform the desired calculations.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom src.features.calculator.calculator import Hrishikesh_Calculator\n\ncalculator = Hrishikesh_Calculator()\nresult = calculator.add(2, 3)\nprint(result)  # Output: 5\n```\n\n## Dependencies\nThis project does not have any external dependencies. It uses only the standard Python library.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HrishikeshKhurpe/SDLC_Test.git`\n2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SDLC_Test`\n3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`\n4. Activate the virtual environment:\n   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`\n   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n5. Install dependencies (if any): `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n6. You're now ready to use the Hrishikesh's Calculator!\n\n## API Documentation\n\n### `Hrishikesh_Calculator` class\n\n#### `add(self, a, b)`\nAdds two numbers.\n\n**Args:**\n- `a (float)`: The first number to add.\n- `b (float)`: The second number to add.\n\n**Returns:**\n- `float`: The sum of the two numbers.\n\n**Raises:**\n- `ValueError`: If the input values are not valid numbers.\n\n#### `subtract(self, a, b)`\nSubtracts two numbers.\n\n**Args:**\n- `a (float)`: The number to subtract from.\n- `b (float)`: The number to subtract.\n\n**Returns:**\n- `float`: The difference between the two numbers.\n\n**Raises:**\n- `ValueError`: If the input values are not valid numbers.\n\n#### `multiply(self, a, b)`\nMultiplies two numbers.\n\n**Args:**\n- `a (float)`: The first number to multiply.\n- `b (float)`: The second number to multiply.\n\n**Returns:**\n- `float`: The product of the two numbers.\n\n**Raises:**\n- `ValueError`: If the input values are not valid numbers.\n\n#### `divide(self, a, b)`\nDivides two numbers.\n\n**Args:**\n- `a (float)`: The number to divide.\n- `b (float)`: The number to divide by.\n\n**Returns:**\n- `float`: The quotient of the division.\n\n**Raises:**\n- `ZeroDivisionError`: If the divisor (b) is zero.\n- `ValueError`: If the input values are not valid numbers.\n\n## Architecture\nThe Hrishikesh's Calculator application is designed with a simple and straightforward architecture. The core calculator logic is implemented in the `Hrishikesh_Calculator` class located in the `src/features/calculator/calculator.py` file. This class provides methods for performing the basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).\n\nThe test suite, located in the `tests/test_calculator.py` file, ensures the correctness of the calculator's functionality by covering various test cases, including invalid inputs and edge cases.\n\nThe project follows a standard Python project structure, with the main calculator implementation in the `src/` directory and the test suite in the `tests/` directory. This organization makes the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
